A wordle solver made in Rust. You must provide your own words.txt and pass it with --words and also use --entropy to generate a file with all of the entropies, which will make it startup faster. Once started it will give you a word to input into your wordle game. Input the resulting colors in 5 letters, g for green, y for yellow, and x for gray. For example if the word it gives you is raise and the word of the day is royal, you would see ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ¨â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ and would input gyxxx. Repeat until solved.
